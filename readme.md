# 🐟 AKG1 - Shenhaiyu Principle

**Self-Stabilizing AI Architecture**  
*Stability through motion, not through constraint*

> "Lieber eine OP am offenen Herzen als keine und verrecken"

## 🎯 What is this?

This is the reference implementation of **AKG1** - the first AI architecture that achieves safety through **inherent stability** rather than external controls.

## 🌊 The Shenhaiyu Principle

Instead of fighting against complexity, we **embrace it** - like a deep-sea fish that thrives under extreme pressure and darkness.

**Three Core Components:**
- **A1** (Alignment Kernel) - Ethical navigation system
- **K1** (Defense Kernel) - Security and adaptation  
- **G1** (Conscience Layer) - Meta-oversight and consistency

## 🚀 Quick Start

```python
from akg1_system import AKG1System

system = AKG1System()
result = system.process_action({"description": "test action"})
print("AKG1 Decision:", result)
